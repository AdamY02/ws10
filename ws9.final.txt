Assmann writes \\"ancient Egypt is an intellectual and spiritual world that is linked to our own by numerous strands of tradition.\\" He discusses, for example, the influences of works such as \\"The Admonitions of Ipuwer\\" [13th cent.BC]on Bertold Brecht who used parts of it in his play \\"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\\". He explains the most important Egyptian philosophical concept \\"ma'at\\" or \\"connective justice\\" (illustrated in \\"The Eloquent Peasant\\" a Middle Kingdom work but holding \\"for Egyptian civilization in general\\" in terms of the ideas of both Karl Marx and Nietzsche.<br />  Most importantly he shows what the Egyptian state really stood for as opposed to the false images found in Old Testament propaganda that mispresents Eqypt as an oppressive slave state. \\"The Egyptian state.\\" he says, \\"is the implementation of a legal order that precludes the natural supremacy of the strong and opens up prospects for the weak (the 'widows' and 'orphans') that otherwise would not exist.\\"<br />  Unlike many who think that the revolution initiated by Akhenaten perished with him, Assmann presents evidence that its main principles survived in other religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well in secular venues from Greek philosophy \\"to the universalist formulas of oun own age as embodied in the physics of Einstein and Heisenberg.\\"<br />It is possible that many of the ideas of \\"Christianity\\" were originally formulated by the Egyptians.<br />  Today we know more about the Ancient Egyptians than ever before so we should \\"attempt to enter into a dialogue with the newly readable messages of ancient Egyptian culture and thus to reestablish them as an integral part of our cultural memory.\\"<br />I have only skimmed the surface of this important book. Anyone who wants to understand ancient Egypt must read this book.\\"	2005-10-13

The premise that one must do exactly what the author says is the \\"right\\" way to live the gospel is incorrect. Also his allusion to getting lost in the woods is very silly. If the only way back to his camp sight is from the other side of the mountain then how in the world did he get there? Because there is obviously a way to get to his camp site from there, because that is how he got far from it. <br /> <br />And one certainly CAN figure out how a machine or other apparatus works because people have done that for many years.  <br /> <br />Examples: During war, people who decode and figure out how to use the oppositions technologies, codes, etc. <br /> <br />My favorite example though is a 2 to 4 year old knowing better than an adult how to run a computer program without reading any manuals at all.  <br /> <br />My point is, finding out what our life is about is up to us. We do need to constantly figure out how to improve ourselves by looking inward. Our faults are ours and only God knows them as well as we, but God leaves it to us to change our hearts and learn and grow.   <br /> <br />It is up to us to decide how we can best share our talents. God will not pull us along by the nose, but he will guide us gently if we learn how to listen in our hearts and that skill comes from looking within.  <br /> <br />So the whole premise of the book is flawed.  <br /> <br />If you would like to find out God's purpose for you and how He would like you to live, simply look in the book/bible he has provided us, and Jesus' example. Didn't Jesus say it best? The only great commandment was to love. Love God and others as yourself. (Perhaps it would serve all humanity if we learn to love ourselves more truely so we can also do so to others!) <br />	2005-09-28
US	52496677	R3DP5N0LCA4OP8	1888451777	929984897	Godlike	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Revisiting Paul Verlaine and Arthur Rimbaud: Another Season with Hell	Richard Hell continues to startle, shock, and energize the art world with his juicy creative spins, traits which initiated the Punk music era in the 1970s and have continued to challenge stagnations in music, poetry and literature with his naughty and knotty publications.<br /><br />GODLIKE is Hell's homage to similar minds of the 19th century. Written as a memoir + essay from his hospital bed in 1997, his narrator (who sounds very like Hell himself) is the old poet Paul Vaughn writing about his obsessive love affair with a young lad, fellow poet \\"T.\\" (Randell Terence Wode), a lad who migrated from the sticks of Kentucky to the wilds of beatnik New York and began a torrid sexual liaison with Paul, a bizarre symbiotic tryst that carried them across the Eastern seaboard in a drug and alcohol induced stupor. And if the story sounds familiar then that is part of Hell's success. The story updates and parallels the infamous gay relation ship between poet Paul Verlaine and the disturbingly brilliant youth Arthur Rimbaud, two of France's most influential poets who changed their medium dramatically.<br /><br />Others have used the Verlaine/Rimbaud biography to fine ends in film ('Total Eclipse' with Leonardo DiCaprio as Rimbaud and David Twelis as the older Verlaine) and in contemporary opera ('Season in Hell' by Harold Blumenfeld), but her Richard Hell not only pays homage to these great poets, he gives them contemporary words and poems and adventures that result in the most viscerally accurate vision of that duos' influence on poetry.<br /><br />Hell writes pithy, tart, smarmy prose, describing the physical meanderings of sexual liaisons while keeping his eye clearly focused on the poetic geneses those encounters initiated. While not all of the short novel is successful (there is a portion when Paul and T. are not the focus when the writing becomes a bit too self-indulgent - aimless writing for words' sakes), when Hell is on target the story is captivating.<br /><br />It helps considerably to have some background on Verlaine and Rimbaud's lives and works to appreciate the grit of this tale and taking the time to read some of the two poets' poetry will serve the reader well. But Hell's philosophical musings are excellent: \\"Those who die young don't know what they're missing! It's all worked out. The older one gets, the more one's drawn to the sky. And of course that's where one is heading. The sky of anti-admonition: a premonition. Not a threat but a promise. Heaven to flow in disintegration that way.\\"<br /><br />Richard Hell may not be in the realm of great authors, but is assuredly in the ranks of the challenging disrupters! He is worth paying attention to if you have questions as to the boundaries of literature!
